#ifdef __APPLE__
//
// From config.h:
//
//    Suppress extern inline (with or without __attribute__ ((__gnu_inline__)))
//    on configurations that mistakenly use 'static inline' to implement
//    functions or macros in standard C headers like <ctype.h>.  For example,
//    if isdigit is mistakenly implemented via a static inline function, a
//    program containing an extern inline function that calls isdigit may not
//    work since the C standard prohibits extern inline functions from calling
//    static functions (ISO C 99 section 6.7.4.(3).  This bug is known to occur
//    on:
//
//      OS X 10.8 and earlier; see:
//      https://lists.gnu.org/r/bug-gnulib/2012-12/msg00023.html
//
//      ...
//
//    MacOS 10.9 and later define __header_inline indicating the bug is fixed
//    for C and for clang but remains for g++; see
//    <https://trac.macports.org/ticket/41033>.
//
// MacOS 10.9 and later define __header_inline in sys/cdefs.h that is included
// from stdlib.h, so include the latter to define it if applicable.  This MUST
// be #include'd before config.h since it tests for __header_inline.
